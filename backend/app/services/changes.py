"""Propose, confirm and reject changes to requirements.

The safety design:
  * propose  -> saves a PENDING change. Nothing is applied.
  * confirm  -> ONE transaction: check version, apply, bump version, audit, impact analysis.
  * reject   -> closes the pending change without applying it.
Every step writes an audit row in the same transaction as the data change. Confirming also runs
the automatic impact analysis (services/impact.py) in that same transaction.
